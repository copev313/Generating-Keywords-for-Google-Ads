# Generating-Keywords-for-Google-Ads
We automatically generate keywords for a search engine marketing campaign using Python.

### Project Description
We were tasked with creating a prototype set of keywords for search campaigns of a massive online retailer of furniture. The most important task was structuring a search engine marketing account by mapping the right keywords to the right ads and making sure they sent users to the right landing pages.
